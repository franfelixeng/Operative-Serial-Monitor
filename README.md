# About the project

Operative Serial Monitor is a linux serial monitor interface for arduino boards or any other with serial usb communication.
It is known that the arduino IDE has an integrated serial monitor, but other IDE's, although more professional, often do not have a good serial communication interface. So, Operative Serial Monitor offers an IDE-independent interface, allowing you to work with your favorite IDE, without losing those advantages. In addition, it allows changing the font, color and size of the text. And yet, the log color mode, which writes each type of log with different colors.
